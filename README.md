#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic and disciplined approach to the development, functioning and maintainance of sofware
Software engineering methodologies are used to handle large projects without any issues
Efficiently plan for everything and reduce things that are not required hence managing costs
Using a software engineering technique reduces costs and saves time
Reduces complexity of large challenges by breaking them into smaller and more manageable ones that are solved one at a time

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Invention of compilers
Development of structured and object-oriented programming
Rise of agile development methodology
Emergence of internet, cloud computing and AI


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning - encompases gathering and documenting project goals, objectives and requirements
Requirement analysis - Identifies and records the precise requirements of the final user.
System Design - Building the framework of the application. It includes creating the software structure, navigation, user interfaces and database design based on the requirements of the user
Implementation - Converting design to code. It aims to develop software that is functional and user-friendly.
Testing - Involves thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that may have slipped through during code
Deployment - It involves rolling out the meticulously tested and fine-tuned software to its end users
Maintenance - It involves adapting to the ever-changing user and software needs i.e. respoding to user feedback, resolving unexpected issues and upgrading software based on user's evolving requirements

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next step while agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes the relationship between development and testing stages i.e. each development stage has a testing stage.
Agile is used when project requirements are likely to evolve or when flexibility and adaptability are key e.g. projects with a high degree of risk or where continuous deliveyry and feedback are important while waterfall is used when project requirements are well-understood and stable.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer - Design, develop, test and maintain software applications
Quality assurance engineer - Ensures products or services meet a required standard by testing, identifying defects and collaborating with development teams to implement solutions
Product manager - To develop and manage a product's lifecycle, ensuring its commercial success and aligning it with business goals


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES streamline the software development process by providing a unified platform for writing code, to debugging and testing, thus enhancing developer productivity and facilitating collaboration e.g VS Code, Jetbrains
VCs on the other hand facilitate better collaboration and faster development by enabling safe, organized and efficient tracking of changes to code and files e.g. git and github

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Managing time - prioritizing tasks by importance and using project management tools
Adapting to rapid technological change - Continuous learning and staying up to date with industry trends
Dealing with evolving customer requirements - Proactively seeking feedback from users and involving them in the software development process

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - Involves testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components or modules used by your software.
Integration - Verify that different modules or services of your application work well together
System - Evaluates the entire integrated software system as a whole, focusing on how different components interact and whether the system meets the specified requirements
Acceptance -  These are formal tests that verify that a system meets all its business requirements. They focus on replicating user behaviour


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the input given to an ai model to achieve the most accurate, relevant and desired output

Maximizes perfomance leading to accurate and context-aware responses
Saves time and effort by minimizing the need for repeated interactions
Improves reliability by reducing ambiguity and increase consistency of outputs
Tailors responses for technical tasks, creative writing and data analysis

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me something about climate change

Summarize the main causes and effects of climate change in less than 150 words, focusing on human activities and environmental impacts.

Clarity - specifies what information is needed
Scope - Limits the content to key areas
Length constraints - Guides the model to provide a concise response
Purpose driven - Tailors the answers for a quick and focused  understanding
